This project explores converting any image into ASCII format. There are 3 versions:
1. Prints sequence of still images from any of the sequence folders in /pics (specify folder in code) onto terminal (so far I have used Command Prompt only)
2. Prints sequence of still images from any of the sequence folders in /pics (specify folder in code) onto a pygame window (requires pygame library to be installed)
3. Uses your webcam to display live video and ASCII version of it in 2 separate windows. Close the pygame window to terminate the program.
